# ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 1vs1 Script  - world famous CS:GO gamemode in 1 simple command!

**1vs1 Script** is a small file that lets you setup 1vs1 gamemode on your private CS:GO server using one easy to remember command.

With my script, you can organise 1vs1 duel with your friend on fair and improved rules on any map you choose. After loading my script on the server:
- teams won't be automatically balanced
- half-match screen will be disabled to speed up the match

And many, many more - **all toggleable and changeable inside the script, based on your own preferences!**

If you want to edit my script, just open `1vs1.cfg` file using any text editor and change every parameter you want!

üî∞ **This script is 100% safe and legal, you can't get banned because of it on any server besides its secured by VAC, Easy Anti-Cheat, FACEIT AC or any other possible anticheat application. It also won't change any of your personal CS:GO settings.**
