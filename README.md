# 1vs1-Script
ü§º‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **1vs1 Script is a small file that lets you setup 1vs1 gamemode on your private CS:GO server using one easy to remember command.**

With my file, you can organise 1vs1 duel with your friend on fair and improved rules on any map you choose. After loading my script on the server:
- teams won't be automatically balanced
- half-match screen will be disabled to speed up the match
- global Voice-Chat will be enabled (so you can talk with your enemy during the match)

And many, many more - **all toggleable** and **changeable inside the script**, based on your own preferences!

If you want to edit my script, just open `1vs1.cfg` file using any text editor and change every parameter you want!

:beginner: **This script is 100% safe and legal, you can't get banned because of it on any server besides its secured by VAC, Easy Anti-Cheat, FACEIT AC or any other possible anticheat application. It also won't change any of your personal CS:GO settings. **
